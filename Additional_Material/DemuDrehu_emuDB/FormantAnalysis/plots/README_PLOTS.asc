Notes
=====

If a plot file name in the following contains an 'F*', this expands to F1, F2, F3, F4 in the actual plot file names.
If a plot file name contains the string 'NoOutliers', the plot is based on data where outliers 
  have been removed, if the their euclidian|mahalanobis distance in the F1/F2 space (option --outlierMetric, 
  'Outlier detection metric') to the phoneme class center is larger then the value given in option --outlierThreshold 
  ('Outlier detection threshold').
If a plot file name contains the string 'Bark', the frequency scales of the plot have been converted from Hz to Bark. 
  The formula for the conversion is taken from: 
  Traunmueller, H. (1990) "Analytical expressions for the tonotopic sensory scale" J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 88: 97-100.
Plots are based on values stored in CSV tables (see ../csv_tables/READE_CSV.asc); whereever possible, we list the 
  relevant tables together with the plot file description. 

Plot Files
==========

F*CenteredOnMax.pdf :

Assemble plots of the trajectories of formant F* of all extracted vowels (colors) over absolute time in ms.
The tracks are centered on the maximum value of F* in the middle median-smoothed 50% of each vowel segment (to mitigate 
coarticulation influence); the center is marked with a solid black line (time 0).
This may lead to the illusion that different phones have different lengths, when in fact they are centered on 
their respective maximum.
CSV table: TimeNormalizedMedianSmoothedFormantTracks.csv

F*TrackTimeNormalizedMean.pdf :
F*TrackTimeNormalizedMedian.pdf :

Plots of the Mean/Median of F* trajectories over normalized time for all extracted phoneme classes (colors).
The number of averaged tracks per phoneme class is printed as a colored number on the left-hand side of the formant plot.

VowelTrapezoidMean[NoOutliers].pdf :
VowelTrapezoidMedian[NoOutliers].pdf :

Plots of the Mean|Median values of reversed F1 over F2 in a (vowel) trapezoid of the physiological limits 
of F1 and F2 in American English [1] and Canadian French [2]: 
  F1=180-900Hz, F2=500-3000Hz for male and F1=180-1100Hz, F2=500-3000Hz for female.
The averaged F1/F2 vowel position of just the *queried* *cardinal* vowels within the trapezoid are calculated as the Mean|Median over all vowel segments, where for each vowel 
segment the F1/F2 formant values are the average Mean|Median over the mid 50% of the tracks. In the 'NoOutlier' plots outliers are removed before calculating 
the Mean|Median over the vowel segments. The number under each vowel position is the total number of vowel segments (after outlier removal).
The VowelTrapezoid plots are intended to give a quick overview about the speaker's acoustic space in comparison to the 
physiologically possible vowel space as indicated by the trapezoid. The cardinal vowels are defined as:
  cardinals_ipa_unrounded = c("i","e","ɛ","a","ɑ","ʌ","ɤ","ɯ","ɨ","i:","e:","ɛ:","a:","ɑ:","ʌ:","ɤ:","ɯ:","ɨ:")
  cardinals_ipa_rounded = c("y", "ʉ", "u", "o", "ɒ", "ɔ", "œ", "ø", "ɶ","y:", "ʉ:", "u:", "o:", "ɒ:", "ɔ:", "œ:", "ø:", "ɶ:")
  cardinals_sampa_unrounded = c("i","e","E","a","A","V","7","M","1","i:","e:","E:","a:","A:","V:","7:","M:","1:")
  cardinals_sampa_rounded = c("y", "}", "&", "2", "9", "O", "o", "u", "Q", "y:", "}:", "&:", "2:", "9:", "O:", "o:", "u:", "Q:")
All other requested vowel symbols are ignored in these plots.

VowelSpacePlotMean[Bark][NoOutliers].pdf :
VowelSpacePlotMedian[Bark][NoOutliers].pdf :
F3F2PlotMean[Bark][NoOutliers].pdf :
F3F2PlotMedian[Bark][NoOutliers].pdf :

Traditional vowel space plots of F1 over F2 and F3 over F2 on reversed frequency scales. Each extracted segment is plotted by
one color-coded label at the position of the Mean|Median taken from the mid 50% of the formant track
(or from the exact midpoint if option --midpoint true ('Select from midpoint')). Additionally, for each phoneme class 
distribution a color-coded elipse respresenting a 95% confidence interval assuming a t-normal distribution is plotted.

Examples
========

'VowelTrapezoidMeanNoOutliers.pdf' is a Hz scaled F1/F2 vowel space plot into a trapezoid with gender-specific cardinal vowels
where each cardinal vowel class is plotted as label in the reversed F1/F2 position that is the mean over all
extracted segment means taken from the mid 50% of each formant track; outlier segments are not included. 
'VowelSpacePlotMedianBark.pdf' is a traditional F1/F2 vowel space plot with reversed Bark frequency 
scales in which each plotted (color-coded) phoneme label represents the F1/F2 medians over the mid 50% values of 
the formant tracks (or over the track mid point values if option --midpoint true); outliers are not removed.
